# ml-bootcamp
A repository which contains my assignment solutions for GDG Cloud Edmonton's ML Bootcamp, which runs from June 26 to August 1, 2021.

## How to run
Use pip to install the necessary dependencies:

``` pip install pandas ``` (since the bootcamp is ongoing, this list is a WIP.)

The solutions can be found under the ```assignments``` folder.

## Data
All data used in the assignments is sourced from the Kaggle dataset for the Titanic ML Competition. Details can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
